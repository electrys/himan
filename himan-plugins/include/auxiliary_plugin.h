 *
 * Auxiliary plugins are used to help the calculation of parameters.
 * They do not calculate parameters themselves.
 *
 * Aux plugins are generally not called from the main executable but
 * from other plugins. In the executable we only reveal the auxiliary
 * plugin interface (described by this file), which generally does not
 * contain any useful function calls since aux plugins are quite varying
 * in nature.
 *
 * If we'd want to call an individual plugin's functions from the
 * executable, we would have to link the executable against the plugin
 * library which destroys the whole notion and idea of a "plugin system."
